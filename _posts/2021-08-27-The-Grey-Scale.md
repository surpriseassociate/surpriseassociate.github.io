Title: The Grey Scale

# The Grey Scale

I've been trying to think of a way to quantify how I perceive jobs when I apply for them. I'm smart, I have some skills, and I have spent my life being constantly undervalued by prospective employers.

As a little story, I appled for a job and told them I wanted 70k to do a basic level 2 systems engineer position with occasional project work. I was like "I can get a CompSci grad with CCNE for $40k!". I told the hiring manager, "Okay that's fine. Hire that grad with his CCNE for that money, but just remember that you get what you pay for. When it doesn't work out, give me a call".

I ended up securing a pretty unique job a month later and started immediately, above my asking price, doing something I had never done before. On day 2 of this job I received a job offer above my asking price because the CompSci grad with his CCNE couldn't perform and didn't make it past probation.

People need to stop undervaluing tech. If you can afford inexperience, pay the lower amount and foster that employee. If you can't afford the inexperience, then pay the premium for a tech that will carry you.

This experience also shaped me. I have been to so many job interviews and met so many people with such varying methods of interviewing people. I can give you an extremely easy way to filter through people face-to-face, but we'll get to that later. Right now, we're focussing on how I assess companies the moment that I walk into your office.

## The History

## The Scale

The scale is very simple.

- White.
- Grey.
- Black.

White is a full spectrum of light, colors, openness.
Grey is dull, but safe. It's consistent, yet drearily so. It's neither one way or the other, it's a compromise of both.
Black is a deep abyss of emptiness. Enough said.

Companies can sit anywhere between white and black, or light and dark. Some places might be a lighter/darker shade of grey, or might be decidedly black.

## Applying the Scale

We'll look at some factors that explain the levels so that you can see what I mean.

We consider every place starts off grey; when you're approaching a new role, there's likely a lot of doubt and uncertainty. A lot of this sets in before you get to your interview, but you'll have made contact and verified the company profile before heading in, so you have a rough idea. The moment you start searching,
