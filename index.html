<h1>Surprise Associate</h1>

Inspiration for code normally comes from where I'm working, and I don't like publically discussing work stuff in a way that links to a specific company.

A *lot* of my code in Github is in private repos, broken up amongst numerous shell organizations to keep things neat. 

<ul>
{% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><a href='{{ post.url }}'>
        {{ post.title }}
    </a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
