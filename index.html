      <p>I haven't played with Github Pages in quite a while. Most of my work lately has been in Jekyll and the transition has been a little jarring.</p>

        <h2>Show me the code!</h2>
        <p>I keep all my code neatly organized into multiple surprise companies in Github. The vast majority of my code and work is hidden in private repos, however when somethings deemed appropriately sanitized and public-ready, it's switched to public so that people can benefit from what I've done.</p>
        <p>You may not be able to see all of my work, but here's a list of my surprise companies that have some interesting files in it for you to peruse:</p>

        <h2>Release Reports</h2>
        <p>I'll often copypasta the README into a post for this site whenever a project is publicized. Here are the most recent 5 posts:</p>
        <ul class="icon-list">
          {% for post in site.posts limit 5 %}
            <li><a href='{{ post.url }}' rel="noopener">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
          {% endfor %}
            <li><a href='{{ posts | absolute_url }}' rel="noopener">Read More</a></li>
